Just another aggregating politicians to call while you're in the bathroom website

## to-do
* make a first release that features nominations, votes, and issues to call about at the federal level, and allows people to quickly call those people.
  * pull in list of nominations, votes, and issues to call about using ProPublica Congress API or Sunlight Congress API?
  * pul in content about that issue for people to peruse easily
  * figure out the most user friendly way to link people to their politicians
    * location-based?
    * automatically provides the phone numbers for who you can call (building from Sunlight's Congress API: https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/)
  * allow users to rate the call and the poop
  * after the call is over, the user is directed to a reporting feature with a quick form to ask how the call went

## Other Potential site features:
* show how many people have made calls while pooping, or are pooping right now.
* A way for users to submit new issues to the list of issues?
* A tracking page that shows past issues people have called about, with saved data on how many people called while pooping, and what the effect of the calls was, if any.
  * This tracking would also ideally feed into the "more info about an issue" page that people call from, so that people can see how effective it will be to call that person--who responds (if anyone) and who doesn't, what have they done since they got those calls, etc--in order to maximize your sessions.
